"UNHCR is currently working with the authorities and other actors to determine the size of the population that found an effective nationality solution under Law 169-14. Since the adoption of Law 169-14 in May 2014, important steps have been taken by the Dominican Republic to confirm Dominican nationality through the validation of birth certificates of individuals born in the country to two migrant parents before 2007. According to information shared by the Dominican delegation during the 2019 High-Level Segment on Statelessness, approximately 48 per cent of the total Group A population of 61,049 persons had been authorized by the National Electoral Board (JCE) to request their nationality documentation. Additionally, as of December 2019, over 1,700 Group B persons (900 of which were children) had submitted applications for naturalization to the Ministry of Interior and of the Police (MIP).

The number of victims of displacement who are deceased, direct victims of forced disappearance and homicide, and other victims who, for various reasons, cannot effectively access these measures, are identified as not being subject to attention or reparation and therefore not included in the figure of 7 million.

"The UK’s stateless figures show the number of stateless individuals recognised through the UK's stateless determination procedure since it began in 2013.

The UK Government has now provided data for initial and subsequent grants. The subsequent grants have therefore been removed from the previous cumulative figure between 2013 - 2018. Since 2019, the cumulative figure now only includes initial grants of leave following individuals’ recognition as stateless. As of mid-2024, the total number of individuals recognised under UK’s statelessness determination procedure is 394.
